# Pareto_Set 
(*This program is still on progress.)

This program is for implementing multi-objective optimization based on abstract data type (ADT).
There are two folders, 1) Pareto (main class) and 2) TestParetoSet (for testing this program).

Pareto means that observations which are lower is better. For example, [A,1,3] is better than [B,2,4].

This program has a purpose for learning nodes and creating ADT to collect observations, and it is one of an individual assignments using Dr.Java.
